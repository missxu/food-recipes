Lazy Mimi's Broccoli Soup
-credit to Mimi Hui

1 bag of chopped frozen broccoli
1 bouillon cube
hot water to cover the broccoli
small handful of walnuts or cashews (your choice!)

Add everything _except nuts_ to a pot and bring to a boil. Once broccoli is tender, take off heat and let cool. 
Once cool enough, toss in nuts, blend with immersion blender. Reheat and serve. Works great in a microwave.
You'll want to cover it so it doesn't get everywhere.

Notes: my immersion blender splatters which is why I suggest letting it cool. If yours doesn't, you can toss the nuts in while it's hot, blend, and enjoy!
